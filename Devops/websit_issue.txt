Goto credential >system> global credentials > select: Kind: user/pass/secret file/secret text
scope: global

Ans: using Global Slack Notifier Setting

CI-CD : What is CI-CD?
How does CI/CD co-relate with devops?
Explain the CI/CD pipeline of your project?
What is the difference between  continuous deployment & continuous delivery?

Lambda : Multi part upload utility : upload a single object as a set of parts. improve throghput, quick recovery from network, paus/resume object,
